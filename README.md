# Speech to Sign Language Translator

A powerful Python application that converts speech and text into sign language animations in real-time. This tool helps bridge the communication gap between hearing and non-hearing individuals by providing an intuitive interface for sign language translation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken words to text using Google's Speech Recognition API
- **Text Input**: Type text directly for sign language translation
- **Real-time Animation**: View sign language animations for words and individual letters
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive GUI built with tkinter
- **Comprehensive Dictionary**: Supports common words and phrases
- **Letter-by-Letter Translation**: Fallback to individual letter animations for unknown words

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Working microphone (for speech recognition)
- Internet connection (for speech recognition API)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-sign-language.git
cd speech-to-sign-language
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python pillow SpeechRecognition tensorflow keras
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 💻 Usage

1. **Text Input**:
   - Type your text in the input box
   - Click "Convert" to see the sign language animation

2. **Voice Input**:
   - Click "Record Voice"
   - Speak clearly into your microphone
   - The text will appear in the input box
   - Click "Convert" to see the sign language animation

3. **Viewing Animations**:
   - Animations will play automatically
   - Each word or letter will be shown in sequence
   - Animations loop until completion
